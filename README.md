# Biomedical Word Embeddings for Spanish: Development and Evaluation

This repository contains the biomedical word embeddings generated from Spanish corpora.

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and access to files

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2542722

## Directory Structure

The example below shows the structure for the Wikipedia subset with 50 dimensions. All other subsets have the same structure

<pre>
Wikipedia/
    50/
        W2V_wiki_w10_c5_50_15epoch.txt: Word2Vec in text file
        wiki_w10_c5_50_15epoch.w2vmodel: Word2Vec in gensim file
        wiki_w10_c5_50_15epoch.w2vmodel.trainables.syn1neg.npy: Word2Vec in gensim file
        wiki_w10_c5_50_15epoch.w2vmodel.wv.vectors.npy: Word2Vec in gensim file
    Wikipedia_Fasttext.bin: fastText embedding in binary file.
    Wikipedia_Fasttext.vec: fastText embedding in text file.

## Corpora used

* Scielo Full-Text in Spanish: We retrieved all the full-text available in Scielo.org (until December/2018) and processed them into sentences. Scielo.org node contains all Spanish articles, thus includes Latin and European Spanish.
  * Sentences: 3,267,556
  * Tokens: 100,116,298
* Wikipedia Health: We retrieved all articles from the following Wikipedia categories: Pharmacology, Pharmacy, Medicine and Biology. Data were retrieved during December/2018.
  * Sentences: 4,030,833
  * Tokens: 82,006,270
* Scielo+Wikipedia Health: We concatenated the previous two corpora.

## Embeddings generation

Two different approaches were used: [Word2Vec](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec) and [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) .

### Word2Vec

We used the python [Gensim package](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) to train different Word2Vec embeddings.
The following configurations were set:
* Embedding dimension: 50, 150 and 300.
* Epochs 15
* Window size: 10
* Minimum word count: 5
* Algorithm: CBOW
* Copora: Scielo, Wikipedia and Scielo+Wikipedia

### fastText

We used the [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) to train word embeddings.
We kept all standard options for training.
The following corpora were used: Scielo, Wikipedia and Scielo+Wikipedia

## Evaluation

Evaluation was carried out by both extrinsic (with a Named Entity Recognition framework) and intrinsic, with the three already available datasets for such task UMNSRS-sim, UMNSRS-rel, and MayoSRS.  
With NER, we defined that the best model was with 300 dimensions, and projected the words using Principal Component Analysis.

Further details about evaluation and the steps performed can be found in our [paper](Biomedical_Word_Embeddings_for_Spanish__Development_and_Evaluation.pdf) in this respository.

The PCA plots for our embedding and a general-domain embedding are available in this repository also:

The translations for Spanish in TSV format of the UMNSRS and Mayo datasets one are also availabe in this Github repository:
